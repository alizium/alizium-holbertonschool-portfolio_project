## Idea Evaluation (Comparative Analysis)

To evaluate the three ideas, I defined four main criteria:
- **Feasibility**: Can it be built within the time and resources available?
- **Usefulness**: Does it solve a real, common problem?
- **Originality**: Does it stand out compared to existing solutions?
- **Scalability**: Can it be expanded with new features in the future?

| Idea                | Feasibility | Usefulness | Originality | Scalability | Total |
|---------------------|-------------|------------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Expiry Tracker      | 5/5         | 5/5        | 4/5         | 4/5         | 18/20 |
| Recipe Book         | 4/5         | 3/5        | 2/5         | 4/5         | 13/20 |
| Watchlist           | 4/5         | 3/5        | 3/5         | 3/5         | 13/20 |

**Result:** Expiry Tracker received the highest score, making it the most relevant choice for this MVP.

## Decision and Refinement

Based on the evaluation, the **Expiry Tracker Website** was chosen as the final MVP.

### Problem Solved
Many people forget important expiration dates such as ID cards, passports, warranties, or subscriptions.
This leads to stress, financial loss, or administrative issues.  
The Expiry Tracker will provide a simple way to keep all expiration dates in one place, helping users stay organized.

### Target Audience
- Individuals managing personal documents and subscriptions.
- Families who want to track warranties, contracts, or health-related deadlines.
- Students and professionals who need to stay on top of administrative requirements.

### Key Features of the MVP
- Add an item with a name and expiration date.
- Display a list of items sorted by date.
- Highlight items that are about to expire.
- Option to delete items once they are no longer relevant.

### Expected Outcomes
By developing this MVP, users will:
- Avoid missing important expirations.
- Gain peace of mind by centralizing deadlines in one tool.
- Save money and time by renewing on time.
