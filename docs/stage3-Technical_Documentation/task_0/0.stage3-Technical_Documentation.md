## 0. User Stories and Mockups

### User Stories (MoSCoW)

#### Must Have
- As a user, I want to **create an account**, so that I can **save my expiration dates**.  
- As a user, I want to **log in**, so that I can **access my personalized dashboard**.  
- As a user, I want to **add an issue date and an expiration date**, so that I can **track the validity of my documents**.  
- As a user, I want to **see a list of my documents with their status (valid, expiring soon, expired)**, so that I can **know which ones I need to renew**.  
- As a user, I want to **choose a category (Administration, Food, Health, Subscriptions, etc.)**, so that I can **better organize my reminders**.  

#### Should Have
- As a user, I want to **search for a document in a category**, so that I can **find it quickly**.  
- As a user, I want to **edit or delete a document**, so that I can **keep my information up to date**.  
- As a user, I want to **receive specific tips for each document (e.g., renew an ID card 1–2 months before expiration)**, so that I can **anticipate the necessary steps**.  

#### Could Have
- As a user, I want to **receive reminders by email**, so that I can **avoid forgetting important deadlines**.  
- As a user, I want to **add personal notes to my documents**, so that I can **store additional information** (place of issue, file number…).  
- As a user, I want to **customize the frequency of my notifications** (30 days before, 15 days before), so that I can **receive reminders at the right time**.  

#### Won’t Have
- As a user, I want **a native mobile application (iOS/Android)**, so that I can **use the service offline**. *(Potentially planned for a later version)*  
- As a user, I want to **share my reminders with other people**, so that I can **coordinate with others**.  



### Mockups

The **Expiry Tracker** project includes a user interface (UI).  
Mockups were created with **Canva** and exported in PNG format.

These elements define the **user journey** and will serve as the basis for the following stages:  
- Architecture (Task 1)  
- Database and Classes (Task 2)  
- Sequence Diagrams (Task 3)  
- API Specifications (Task 4)  
- SCM & QA (Task 5)
