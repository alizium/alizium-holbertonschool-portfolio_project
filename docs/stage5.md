## Stage 5

### Results and Lessons Learned

I achieved approximately **90% of the planned functionalities** for the MVP as defined in the Project Charter. The main objectives were successfully met, including:

- Implementation of all critical core features.
- An **intuitive user interface**, based on feedback collected during the testing phase.
- Stable performance with no blocking bugs during final demonstrations.
- A smooth and functional live demo aligned with the project expectations.

**Key Metrics:**
- Functional coverage rate: **90%**
- Positive user feedback on UX/UI: **87%** satisfaction (based on test)
- MVP fully operational according to initial goals

### Lessons Learned

**What went well:**
- A **structured planning** of tasks helped me stay organized.
- Using a Kanban-style task board supported steady progress and visibility.
- I maintained a regular development pace, balancing code, testing, and documentation.

**What was challenging:**
- The time allocated for **real-world testing** was insufficient.
- Some technical components required more learning time than anticipated.
- Continuous integration could have been more automated.
- the notification system

**What I will improve in future projects:**
- Allocate more time for **user testing** 
- Anticipate tools and technologies better to avoid mid-project learning bottlenecks.
- Strengthen **test automation** and improve commits.

## Team Retrospective

Since I completed this project individually, I used this retrospective as a personal evaluation of my development process, mindset, and time management.

###  What Went Well
- I maintained a consistent work pace by setting realistic daily goals and tracking progress regularly.
- Task planning and prioritization helped avoid last-minute rushes and reduced stress.
- I actively documented my development steps, which improved my focus and made troubleshooting easier.

###  What Was Challenging
- Working solo meant that all responsibility fell on me — including decisions, design, coding, and testing — which required a lot of energy and context-switching.
- Without a team to brainstorm with, solving complex problems took longer and sometimes lacked perspective.
- It was harder to stay objectively critical of my own work without external feedback.

### What I Would Do Differently Next Time
- Seek early external feedback from peers or mentors to gain perspective and avoid tunnel vision.
- Use more robust time tracking to analyze where most effort goes and improve future planning.
- Incorporate more scheduled breaks and checkpoints to reduce fatigue and improve long-term focus.

### Delivering the Presentation

To prepare for the final presentation, I focused on clarity, structure, and visual impact. My goal was to clearly communicate the project’s value, demonstrate the MVP smoothly, and reflect on the full development process.

#### Preparation Steps
- I created a slide deck highlighting the main stages of the project: ideation, planning, development, and delivery.
- I rehearsed the demo multiple times to ensure smooth transitions and functionality under real-time conditions.
- I refined the narrative flow of the presentation to maintain engagement and stay within time constraints.

#### Presentation Highlights
- Introduced the project context and objective concisely.
- Showcased the MVP’s core features with a live demo.
- Presented architectural decisions, design rationale, and development tools used.
- Reflected on lessons learned and offered ideas for future improvements.

#### Questions
I prepared responses for potential questions regarding:
- Technology choices
- MVP limitations and planned improvements
- Testing strategy and feedback handling

#### Live Presentation

The live demo was prepared and delivered with the following goals:

- Show real-time functionality of the MVP
- Communicate project decisions clearly and professionally
- Answer potential questions with confidence and depth

A video recording or live walkthrough can be provided if needed.
