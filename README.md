# Portfolio Project – Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

This repository contains the complete work for the **Portfolio Project**, a multi-phase initiative to design, develop, and deliver a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**.
The project simulates a real-world software development process, from idea generation to final delivery, following professional practices in project management, documentation, and development.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Objective:**
  To design and implement a functional MVP while gaining hands-on experience with the **software development lifecycle (SDLC)**.
  This includes teamwork (or solo project adaptation), documentation, design, coding, and final evaluation.

- **Importance:**
  By working through this project, the student develops both technical and soft skills:
  - Collaboration, communication, and organization.
  - Technical design and system architecture.
  - MVP development with modern tools and practices.
  - Project documentation and final presentation.

## 🚀 Project Stages

The project is divided into **five stages**:

### **Stage 1 – Team Formation and Idea Development**
- Define team composition and roles (solo = multiple roles).
- Brainstorm and analyze several project ideas.
- Evaluate ideas with SWOT and scoring.
- Select the final MVP.
- Deliverable: **Stage 1 Report** (team formation, brainstorming, evaluation, decision, and documentation).

### **Stage 2**
- Define project scope, objectives, and stakeholders.
- Identify risks and propose mitigation strategies.
- Provide a high-level plan and timeline.
- Deliverable: **Project Charter Document**.

### **Stage 3**
- Create UML class diagrams and system architecture.
- Define workflows and technical stack.
- Provide detailed technical specifications.
- Deliverable: **Technical Documentation Report**.

### **Stage 4**
- Implement the MVP using modern tools and coding practices.
- Focus on code quality, testing, and iteration.
- Deliverable: **Fully functional MVP** hosted in this repository.

### **Stage 5**
- Prepare the final presentation of the MVP.
- Reflect on lessons learned and project outcomes.
- Deliverable: **Closure Report and Presentation**.
